Helpers are classes that are not part of the core system but can greatly improve it by adding new features and possibilities.

This section documents the included helpers and how to use them. Since helpers are classes they can be added to the framework by placing them inside the helpers folder or in sub folders.

> Static classes placed in the root of the helpers folder will be included automatically using the framework autoloader. For none static classes they will need to be loaded in the controller using a loadHelper() call.
