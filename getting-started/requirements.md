# Requirements

The framework requirements are limited.

-   Apache Web Server or equivalent with mod rewrite support.
-   IIS with URL Rewrite module installed - [http://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite](http://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite)
-   PHP 5.5 or greater is required

Although a database is not required, if a database is to be used the system is designed to work with a MySQL database. The framework can be changed to work with another database type such as Medoo for example.
