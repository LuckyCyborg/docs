- Download the framework
- Unzip the package.
- Upload the framework files to your server. Normally the index.php file will be at your root.
- Open the index.php file with a text editor, setup your routes.
- Open core/config.php and set your base URL and database credentials (if a database is needed). Set the default theme.
- Edit .htaccess file and save the base path. (if the framework is installed in a folder the base path should reflect the folder path /path/to/folder/ otherwise a single / will do.
