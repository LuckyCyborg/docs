#Cookie API

All cookies created by the Nova framework are encrypted and signed with an authentication code, meaning they will be considered invalid if they have been changed by the client.

## Retrieving A Cookie Value

{line-numbers=off}
~~~~~~~~
$value = Cookie::get('name');
~~~~~~~~

## Attaching A New Cookie To A Response

{line-numbers=off}
~~~~~~~~
$response = Response::make('Hello World');

$response->withCookie(Cookie::make('name', 'value', $minutes));
~~~~~~~~

## Queueing A Cookie For The Next Response

If you would like to set a cookie before a response has been created, use the `Cookie::queue()` method. The cookie will automatically be attached to the final response from your application.

{line-numbers=off}
~~~~~~~~
Cookie::queue($name, $value, $minutes);
~~~~~~~~

## Creating A Cookie That Lasts Forever

{line-numbers=off}
~~~~~~~~
$cookie = Cookie::forever('name', 'value');
~~~~~~~~

## Forgetting A Cookie
{line-numbers=off}
~~~~~~~~
Cookie::forget('name');
~~~~~~~~
